# "Ants vs Bees" - Tower Defense Game
A full "Plants vs Zombies"-style game created using an object-oriented programming paradigm. This project involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

To play the game with the GUI, either open [gui.html](gui.html) or run from the terminal: 
```
python3 gui.py
```
## Game Premise
As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
